# Probabilistic alignment of connectome networks

The jupyter notebooks provide the code used for the probabilistic bayesian approach to the Network alignment problem for real connectome networks.

### Different experiments:
We are running different experiments. In the description of each experiment it is explained the initial conditions. For example, in the case of C-elegans, The "C-el_k4_Normal.ipynb" accounts for the experiment where we use the latter four connectome (L2,L3,A1,A2), with the information of the groups ( available directly from the database). 


### Databases:
We are working with two databases: 8 connectome networks from different stages of development of C-elegans (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03778-8), and the left-right hemisphere for the connectome of a Drosophila melanoganster larva (https://doi.org/10.1126/science.add933).
